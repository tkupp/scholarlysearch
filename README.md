# Scholarly Search

## A project for CAS 502: Computation

Collaborators: Bill Terry & Travis Kupp

## Description
Searching and collecting data across multiple scholarly resources can be a daunting, tedious, and challenging task. This is especially true if large amounts of data are to be searched in a programmatic way. The goal is to provide a flexible and extensible tool to automate and simplify the task of searching across scholarly research.
